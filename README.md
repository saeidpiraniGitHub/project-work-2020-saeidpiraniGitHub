This project is for post-processing of electromagnetic simulation results. The post-processing is performed for available 7 files with '.txt' suffix in the working folder. 

Final_01.ipynb is the last version of the developed code, you can download and run it. 
Before runing the code it is necessary to download 'iris1.right.txt', 'iris2.left.txt', 'iris2.right.txt', 'iris3.left.txt', 'iris3.right.txt', 'iris4.left.txt' and 'iris4.right.txt' files and put them in the working folder. Moreover to see attached pictures inside the code and get a qualitative overview it is essential to download 6 pictures placed in the repository.
