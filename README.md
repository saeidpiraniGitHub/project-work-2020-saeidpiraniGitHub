This project is for post-processing of electromagnetic simulation results. The post-processing is performed for available 7 files with '.txt' suffix in the working folder. 
Before runing the code it is necessary to download 'iris1.right.txt', 'iris2.left.txt', 'iris2.right.txt', 'iris3.left.txt', 'iris3.right.txt', 'iris4.left.txt' and 'iris4.right.txt' files and put them in the working folder.
Post-processing output will be saved in form of 4 graphs with pdf format.
